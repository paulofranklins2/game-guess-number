# Guessing Game

Welcome to the Guessing Game project! This simple Java console application lets users play a guessing game where they attempt to guess a randomly generated number based on the chosen difficulty level.

## How to Play

1. Run the application.
2. Choose a difficulty level:
    - Easy (1)
    - Medium (2)
    - Hard (3)
    - Impossible (4)
3. Enter your guesses to find the randomly generated number.
4. You have a limited number of attempts based on the difficulty level.
5. Try to guess the correct number within the allowed attempts to win the game!

## Project Structure

The project is organized into three main classes:

1. **GameConfiguration:** Contains constants related to game configurations, such as maximum numbers and the maximum number of attempts.

2. **GameInputHandler:** Handles user input, including the selection of difficulty levels and user guesses.

3. **GuessingGame:** The main class that orchestrates the game logic. It includes methods for generating a random number, playing the game, and calculating the duration of the game.

## Usage

To run the application, execute the `main` method in the `Main` class. Follow the on-screen prompts to choose a difficulty level and make guesses.

## Dependencies

The project has no external dependencies. It uses standard Java libraries for console input and random number generation.
